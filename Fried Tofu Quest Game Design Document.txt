MGQ Beat em up
-Mechanics
1. There is only one stage, filled with obstacles/enemies, with Tamamo as the final boss
2. Luka has an HP BAR(computations for damage, etc. will be handles later), and an MP Bar for skills
The skills are as follows
a.Sylph(mapped to Q,uses 1 MP)- Luka summons Sylph which grants him a barrier that deflects projectiles
b.Gnome(mapped to W,uses 1 MP)- Luka summons Gnome which grants him stagger protection, and halves damage received
c.Undine(mapped to E, uses 4MP)- Luka summons Undine which grants him invulnerability to all damage but depletes the
						MP bar fast until it is over, or Serene Demon Sword is used
d.Salamander(mapped to R,uses 4MP)- Luka summons Salamander which greatly boosts his atk for a short time,
									but you cannot heal during the duration your atk is boosted
e.Meditation(mapped to A,uses 1/3 of max MP)- Luka uses some unknown power which heals him for half his max hp
f.Demon Decapitation(mapped to X) - Luka Slashes the neck of an enemy, doing great damage
									if(Undine is summoned, ability turns into Serene Demon Sword)
	f.1 Serene Demon Sword - With the fluidity of water, Luka cleanly slices an enemy, doing a 1 hit KO if
							it is a normal enemy, or considerably more damage if it is a boss, this also focibly
							ends the Undine summon
g.Thunder Thrust(mapped to forward + X,uses 2MP) - Luka charges forward, thrusting enemies on his way. Enemies hit will take damage
										  Luka is invincible during the charge
										  if(Sylph is summoned, ability turns into Lightning Sword Flash)
	g.1 Lightning Sword Flash - With the power of wind, Luka charges with even more force, and
								leaving behind a trail of lightning bolts
h.Demon Skull Beheading(mapped to down + X, usable only if on air,3MP) - 
						Luka drops down on the enemies, dealing considerable damage, also causing a shockwave
						which deals damage to enemies hit
						if(Gnome is summoned, ability is turned to Earth Rumbling Decapitation)
	h.1 Earth Rumbling Decapitation-Luka uses the power of the Earth so he can freely use this skill even if he is not on air,
								   deals more damage than Earth Rumbling Decapitation, with a larger shockwave
i. Death Sword Chaos Star(mapped to back X, requires a small amount of charge time,4MP)
						- Anyone unlucky enough to be in front of Luka is hit by 5 sword slashes,each dealing great damage
						Luka teleports if he uses this skill, he is also invulnerable for 1 second after casting, easily interruptable
					    with about 3 or 4 seconds casting time. Luka teleports, and anyone between where he was, and where he goes are slashed
						if(Salamander is summoned, ability is turned into Vaporizing Rebel Sword)
	i.1 Vaporizing Rebel Sword - Using the power of fire, each slash becomes infused with fire, making it mroe deadly,
								 each slash does about 1.5 times more damage, and makes Luka invulnerable for 1.5 seconds after casting
j.Quadruple Giga(mapped to X + Z, uses 1 MP)
				- The ultimate attack using the power of the elements, if used, all buffs are nullified,
				  and if hit with anything during the charge time it is cancelled, however it deals 9999 damage to all
				  requires 16 second charging time
3.Z is used as the normal attack button, space to jump, C to block, Arrow keys to move.

4.Normal enemies to follow, depending on the scenario used.
